2.Place the project folder in the Microchip source install directory (c:\Microchip Soultions\ by default)
3.Copy usb_descriptors.c from \Microchip Solutions\USB Device - CDC - Basic Demo\ to this project folder.
4. That's it. You've got the latest source and we're compliant with the license.

Depending on the install location you may need to tweak the include paths under Project->build options.
