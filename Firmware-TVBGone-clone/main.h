/*
This is a simple player for TVBGONE power codes.
Our player is simple because PIC C18 has easy 
reads from program memory. 

This code was written based on the description 
of the data packing method published on the Adafruit 
website. It should be a clean, black-box rewrite, but 
we'll release it as CC 2.5 Attrib & Share Alike 
out of respect for the original authors.
